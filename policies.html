        controlled by Agronomics, we cannot be held responsible for the content,
        accuracy, or opinions expressed on those external sites. Please be aware
        that when you navigate from our Services to another website via a link,
        our Privacy Policy no longer applies. Your interactions on any other

        Third-Party Advertisements and Links
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg">
        This app may include third-party advertisements and links to external
        websites. Agronomics does not endorse or recommend the accuracy or
        suitability of the information contained in those advertisements or
        sites. We do not accept responsibility or liability for the conduct or
        content of these advertisements and external sites, nor for the
        offerings made by third parties.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Advertising plays a crucial role in keeping Agronomics and many of the
        websites and services you use free of charge. Our team works diligently
        to ensure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and relevant.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Please note that third-party advertisements and links to other sites
        where goods or services are advertised do not constitute endorsements by
        Agronomics. We take no responsibility for the content of any ads,
        promises made, or the quality and reliability of products or services
        offered through advertisements.

        Interest-Based Advertising Cookies
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg">
        These cookies gather information over time about your online activity on
        our app. Their purpose is to make online advertisements more relevant
        and effective for you. Additionally, they perform functions such as
        preventing the same ad from repeatedly appearing and ensuring that ads
        display correctly for advertisers. Without these cookies, advertisers
        would find it challenging to reach their target audience or track ad
        impressions and clicks. <br />
        Regarding general cookies:

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-normal">Cookies</h3>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Agronomics utilizes “Cookies” to identify the areas of our website that
        you have visited. A Cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer or
        mobile device by web browser. While Cookies enhance the performance and
        functionality of our app, they are non-essential for its use. However,
        without these cookies, certain features (such as videos) may become
        unavailable, or you might need to enter your login details every time
        you visit the app because we would not be able to remember your previous
        login. Most web browsers allow you to disable the use of Cookies, but
        keep in mind that doing so may impact your ability to access
        functionality on our website correctly or at all. Rest assured; we never
        place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.

        Managing Cookies and Similar Technologies
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Regardless of your location, you have the option to configure your
        browser settings to block cookies and similar technologies. However,
        please be aware that doing so may impact the functionality of our
        website, potentially preventing essential cookies from operating
        correctly. Consequently, you might not be able to fully utilize all the
        features and services available.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg">
        Additionally, consider that blocking cookies could result in the loss of
        saved information, such as login details and site preferences. Each
        browser provides different controls for managing cookies. If you choose
        to disable a specific cookie or category of cookies, it will not
        automatically delete the cookie from your browser—you will need to take
        that action manually within your browser settings.

        In respect to any credit card or other payment processing details you
        have provided us with, we commit that this confidential information will

        Changes To Our Privacy Policy
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg">
        We reserve the right to modify our Service and policies, which may
        necessitate updates to this Privacy Policy to accurately reflect those
        changes. Unless otherwise mandated by law, we will notify you (for
        instance, through our Service) before implementing any amendments to
        this Privacy Policy. If you continue using the Service after the
        updates, you will remain bound by the revised Privacy Policy. However,
        if you disagree with the updated policy, you have the option to delete
        your account.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-normal">What is GDPR?</h3>
      <p class="text-lg">
        GDPR is a detailed privacy and data protection law applicable across the
        European Union (EU). It governs how companies safeguard EU residents’
        data and empowers individuals to exercise greater control over their
        personal information. Importantly, GDPR is not limited to EU-based
        businesses; it applies to globally operating companies. At our
        organization, we prioritize customer data protection regardless of their
        geographical location. As a result, we have adopted GDPR controls as our
        standard practice worldwide. Additionally, here is the section related
